This extension remains fully supported, but will remain on MV2 as long as possible to retain support for older Chromebooks and oppose [other issues with MV3 highlighted by the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation)._

# XKCD Hover Text

This browser extension displays [XKCD](https://xkcd.com) comic hover text below the comic—helpful if you are reading from a touch screen device or prefer to read it that way for any other reason.
